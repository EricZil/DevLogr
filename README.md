## 👀 What's this all about?

**DevLogr** is a powerful platform for developers to showcase their projects, track progress, and engage with their audience. Create beautiful public project pages, document your development journey, and build a portfolio of your work.

**The TL;DR:**
- 🚀 **Project Showcase** - Create beautiful public pages for each of your projects
- 🌍 **Custom Domains** - Use your own domain or our free subdomain
- 🖼️ **Progress Tracking** - Visualize your development journey with milestones and updates
- 👥 **Community Engagement** - Collect feedback and issue reports from users
- 🔐 **Task Management** - Organize your work with built-in project management tools
- 📊 **Public Updates** - Share your progress with regular development updates
- ⚡ **Developer Focused** - Built by developers, for developers

**Also!** Devlogr's bff - Claude AI ❤️

> **⚠️ HEADS UP!** This project has been shipped to SoM! But it's not over;)

## 📓 Devlogs

### Devlog #4 - Mental Breakdown.
![Devlog #4](https://cdn.gcdn.space/SoM/DevLogr/devlog4.png)

Yeahh.. Title says everything. Soo, basically, since last devlog when I said that I'm gonna push it to Vercel, well.. um.. I did. <br>
Little summary from Vercel: <br>
Frontend failed: 12 times <br>
Backend failed: 13 times <br>
And that's not it, I had to rebuilt the WHOLE backend, every single file from scratch. Cause Vercel kept rejecting my backend, and yeah.. Had to rebuilt it completely. (It was nightmare) Funny part is, that when I began rebuilding backend, frontend worked perfectly, but when I had released backend-v2, frontend said bye bye.. Even tho I had fixed frontend with new endpoints from backend-v2. <br>
W H A T E V E R! It's fixed now;) And yeah, I had also developed Custom domain support too! Which is working (can't believe it lol). <br>
Now final touches. Gonna debug everything, fix some UI issues, finish landing page, footer, adjust some CSS. <br>
Can't believe that I am saying this, but - This actually coming LIVE soon! Believe me, yesterday, when I was re-building everything, I was so, sooooo close coming to conclusion to writing last devlog, and saying this is over. Project is cancelled. But... My bff (Claude) gave me hope! And that hope is here! Hosted at Vercel world. The best view to view is when Vercel Dashboard shows status - Ready. (The best view) <br>

Alright, enough of night stories, Devlogr - <br>
Manage your project journey together with Devlogr. <br>
Manage your projects in one place. Let your community know what's happening with your project! Don't let your project be silent! <br>
Manage Milestones, Updates, Issues at one place. Even feedback from the public can give you hope! <br>
This coming live soon! ETA ~ 2-4 hours. <br>

(Ik, dashboard need a big UI change, I will, just that UI is not my priority rn)

### Devlog #3 - DevLogr is not sleeping!
![Devlog #3](https://cdn.gcdn.space/SoM/DevLogr/devlog3.png)

Heyy, ik, ik, it’s been almost 3 days since the last devlog… had some issues behind the scenes, but I’m back on track! <br>

✅ Completed the FULL Public Page (yeah, the page where project Milestones, Updates, Issues, and Feedback will live) <br>
✅ Completed the Project Management Panel <br>
✅ Updated the Dashboard <br>
✅ Fixed a lot of errors (my bffs) <br>

Gonna push it to Vercel soon, but yeah—still no DEMO yet… this project basically runs on the backend, and without it—chaos. So I still need to re-check the whole backend, because I know there are things to work on, as well as custom domain support, and some other things, that I reveal in the next devlog! <br>

At some point I thought—why did I even start this project? It felt impossible to make everything work, connect smoothly, and actually be usable. And how am I going to manage custom domains!? I honestly considered deleting it. But here we are—it’s working! (still can’t believe it lol) <br>

Sooooo yeahh, it wouldn’t be me if I wasn’t making projects like these. I always think this way: What kind of tool do I need to make projects efficient & keep everything on track? That’s DevLogr. <br>

(Sorry, didn't had any good pics to use for this devlog, so I just replaced mock data with real one (not encoded)) <br>

Last devlog I said “I need sleep.” Now—LET’S MAKE IT WORK. <br>
(I slept 5 hours today :’)) <br>

#4 update soon! 💜

### Devlog #2 - A lot.
![Devlog #2](https://cdn.gcdn.space/SoM/DevLogr/devlog2.png)

Added Sign Up / Sign In pages so you can actually get into the platform. <br>
Authentication is working. <br>
Created the Dashboard to manage your project. <br>
Built the Project Management panel (about half the functions are already developed and working). <br>
Created the Public Page template for showcasing your project online (hosted either on our subdomain or your own custom domain). <br>
Added Feedback and Issues forms to the public page, so you can collect everything in one place (issue management works pretty much like GitHub Issues). <br>
Added a bunch of backend endpoints. <br>

Currently experiencing high ms on the backend (might have to rewrite the whole thing if it doesn’t chill). <br>

ETA for the DEMO: around 1–3 days. <br>

After all project management features are finished, I’ll start working on custom domain support. All SSL and config will be handled automatically—just plug in your domain. <br>

I need sleep. <br>
More updates soon. 💜

### Devlog #1 - The Beginning of DevLogr 🚀
![Devlog #1](https://cdn.gcdn.space/SoM/DevLogr/devlog1.png)

Well, here we go again—another adventure begins. <br>

The first version of the frontend for DevLogr. The idea is simple: give developers a slick place to share devlogs, track progress, and show the world what they’re building (or breaking). <br>

Stay tuned. 💜👻
